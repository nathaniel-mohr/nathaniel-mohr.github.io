                    My name is Nathaniel Mohr and I am a 21 year old computer scientist.
                    I am originally from Modesto, California
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was first introduced to the field of Computer Science through two programming courses my sophomore and senior years of high school.
                    I had always had an interest in STEM, but it was these courses that focused my interest to computers and software development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During my undergraduate, my computer science electives had a focus in computer graphics, simulations, and the computation and analysis of numbers.
                    I did research on the adaptation of assembly robots in factories, specifically the simulations that are used in order to program these robots off-line.
                    (Here off-line refers to off the assembly line and not without internet.) My senior capstone project also deals with using simulations, in this case virtual
                    reality, in order to optimize factory processes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since graduating from OSU, I have began an internship with Clean Water Services, a water resources management utility, in their Digital Solutions department. 
                    As a member of the Apps Team, I have the pleasure of updating and developing products that other members of the company use or hope to use.
                    I have been able to work on projects that interest me, such as creating automated reports and developing an AR app.

                    I have an interest in a career involved in the interpretation and analysis of data as well as using simulations to optimize real world scenarios.
                    My minor in mathematics has allowed me to take courses that enhance my understanding of numerical analysis and computational theory.
